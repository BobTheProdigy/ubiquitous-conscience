This is my final project for an introductory MatLab course. My group coded a spin off of Five Nights at Freddy's, but it's just my friend who doesn't leave the library and tries to attack us.
There are different floors, cameras, and logic for the character Bereket on when to approach and retreat a floor. There is a random aspect to the location of Bereket between each floor.
We used loops, statements, images, and uploaded sound effects. To save on runtime, we used pre-photoshopped photos and a downloaded sound to keep the already slow compiler from getting any slower.
